# Python Toy Problems - Week 1 Challenge

This repository contains solutions to the Week 1 Challenge of the Phase 3 Python Toy Problems. The challenge involves solving three distinct problems, each focusing on a different aspect of algorithmic thinking and Python programming.

## Prerequisites

Before running these solutions, ensure you have Python installed on your system. These solutions are written in Python 3 and have been tested with Python 3.8 and above.

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge 1: Equalizing Bricks in Boxes

Problem Statement: Given N boxes, each box numbered from 0 to N-1 containing A[K] bricks, the task is to find the minimum number of moves required to have exactly 10 bricks in each box. A move consists of transferring one brick from a box to an adjacent box.

### Challenge 2: Maximum Sum of Numbers with Equal Digit Sum

Problem Statement: Given an array A consisting of N integers, find the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. If no such pair exists, the solution should return -1.
